Intermediate ballistics is sometimes lumped together with interior ballistics, but has come
into its own category of late. 

Intermediate ballistics is a sub-discipline of ballistics that focuses on the study of the projectile's behavior and dynamics immediately after it leaves the muzzle of the firearm but before it enters its external flight phase.

Intermediate ballistics examines the transitional phase from the barrel to the external environment.

Intermediate ballistics deals with:
1. **Initial tip-off:** This refers to the moment when the projectile starts to move away from the muzzle. It marks the beginning of the external ballistic phase.
2. **Tube and projectile jump:** Tube jump is the phenomenon where the firearm itself experiences a slight movement or jump due to the recoil force generated by the firing. Projectile jump refers to the initial movement of the projectile as it exits the barrel. These movements can impact the trajectory and accuracy of the projectile.
3. **Muzzle device effects:** Muzzle devices, such as flash suppressors and muzzle brakes, can have significant effects during the intermediate ballistics phase. Flash suppressors reduce the visible muzzle flash, and muzzle brakes can influence the recoil and muzzle rise, affecting the overall stability of the firearm.
4. **Sabot discard:** In some ammunition, a sabot (a device used to hold a smaller projectile in a larger-caliber casing) is discarded after leaving the barrel. The process of sabot discard is a part of intermediate ballistics.
