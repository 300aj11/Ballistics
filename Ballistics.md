[[BALLISTICS-Theory_and_Design_of_Guns_and_Ammunition-DonaldECarlucci_SidneySJacobson-3rdEdition.pdf]]


**Science** that deals with the **study of projectiles, their motion, behavior, and effects.**

It encompasses the study of the flight, behavior, and impact of bullets, artillery shells, rockets, and other projectiles.

The field of ballistics can be broadly classified into three major disciplines: 
1. [[Interior Ballistics]],
2. [[Exterior Ballistics]], and 
3. [[Terminal Ballistics]]. 

In some instances, a fourth category named [[Intermediate Ballistics]] has been used.
