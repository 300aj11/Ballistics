Exterior ballistics encompasses the period from when the projectile has left the muzzle until impact with the target.  It covers the entire trajectory of the projectile in the external environment. 

In the context of exterior ballistics, key considerations include:

1. **Projectile dynamics and stability:** This involves understanding how the projectile behaves in flight, including factors like aerodynamics, air resistance, and the stability of the projectile's spin.
2. **Predicted flight path and time of flight:** Exterior ballistics aims to predict the trajectory that the projectile will follow and the time it will take to reach its target. This prediction involves taking into account various environmental factors, such as air density and wind.
3. **Angle, velocity, and location of impact:** The external ballistician is concerned with determining the angle at which the projectile impacts the target, its velocity at impact, and the location where it will strike.
4. **Guidance algorithms:** In modern applications, especially in guided projectiles, exterior ballistics may involve designing or analyzing guidance algorithms. These algorithms help control the projectile's path to achieve a specific target, compensating for factors like wind or target movement.

To perform exterior ballistics calculations, the external ballistician relies on input data from the interior ballistician, who provides information such as muzzle velocity, tip-off, and spin rates. The projectile designer contributes physical properties, such as the shape and mass distribution of the projectile.

The role of the exterior ballistician, sometimes referred to as an aeroballistician, is crucial in optimizing the performance and accuracy of projectiles. By considering the complex interactions between the projectile and the external environment, experts in exterior ballistics contribute to the design and improvement of various types of projectiles, including those used in military, sports, and scientific applications.
