The term "gun" is used in a generic sense and is loosely defined as a one-stroke internal combustion engine. In this case, the projectile is the piston, and the propellant is the airâ€“fuel mixture. 

Guns themselves can be classified in four broad categories:
1. **True Gun:**
    - _Characteristics:_ A direct-fire weapon firing projectiles along a relatively flat trajectory.
    - _Further Classification:_ Rifled or smooth bore, based on primary ammunition.
    - _Mission:_ Predominantly used for direct-fire with a relatively high muzzle velocity.
    - _Examples:_ Tank cannons, machine guns, and rifles.
2. **Howitzer:**
    - _Characteristics:_ An indirect-fire weapon firing projectiles along a curved trajectory to enhance lethal effects at well-emplaced targets.
    - _Versatility:_ While primarily designed for indirect fire, howitzers can be used in a direct-fire role if needed.
3. **Mortar:**
    - _Characteristics:_ Portable tube used to fire projectiles at extremely high trajectories, providing both direct and indirect support to infantry.
    - _Range:_ Generally shorter ranges compared to howitzers, incapable of firing a flat trajectory.
4. **Recoilless Rifle:**
    - _Characteristics:_ Designed with minimal weight, often mounted on light vehicles or man-emplaced.
    - _Counteracting Recoil:_ Utilizes a method of venting high-pressure gas out of a rear nozzle in the breech to counteract normal recoil forces.
    - _Purpose:_ Used in situations where there is insufficient mass to counteract the recoil forces of a projectile firing.
