Interior ballistics deals with the interaction of the gun, projectile, and propelling charge
before the emergence of the projectile from the muzzle of the gun. 

It essentially covers the processes that occur inside the firearm from the moment the trigger is pulled until the projectile is expelled.

This category would include:
1. **Ignition process of the propellant:** This refers to the initial stage where a spark or primer ignites the propellant (gunpowder or other explosive material) in the cartridge.
2. **Burning of propellant in the chamber:** After ignition, the propellant undergoes a rapid combustion process, producing high-pressure gases.
3. **Pressurization of the chamber:** The combustion of the propellant generates gases that rapidly increase the pressure inside the gun chamber.
4. **First-motion event of the projectile:** This marks the moment when the projectile begins to move inside the barrel due to the pressure created by the burning propellant.
5. **Engraving of any rotating band and obturation of the chamber:** As the projectile moves down the barrel, it may have features (such as rotating bands) that engage with the rifling in the barrel, imparting spin to the projectile for stabilization. Obturation refers to the sealing of the chamber to prevent gas leakage.
6. **In-bore dynamics of the projectile:** This involves the study of the projectile's behavior as it travels down the barrel, including factors like acceleration, deceleration, and potential interactions with the rifling.
7. **Tube dynamics during the firing cycle:** This encompasses the study of how the barrel (tube) of the firearm behaves during the firing process, considering factors like barrel vibrations and movements induced by the rapidly expanding gases.
